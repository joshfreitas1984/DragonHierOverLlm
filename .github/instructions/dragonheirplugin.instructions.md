# DragonHeirPlugin — IL2CPP Interop Notes

## Project shape

Single-game BepInEx.Unity.IL2CPP plugin (`GamePlugin.csproj`, namespace `EnglishPatch`) for
*LongYinLiZhiZhuan* ("Dragon Heir"), targeting `BepInEx.Unity.IL2CPP 6.0.0-be.785`. Compiled
directly against the game's real unhollowed assemblies in `BepInEx\interop\` — there is no
Shared/stub project split here, so the "Shared vs host assembly mismatch" failure mode seen in
other Fanslation-style repos does not apply. All other IL2CPP interop hazards below still apply.

Source of these findings: `G:\FanslationStudio.Plugins\.github\copilot-instructions.md` (more
exhaustive, multi-game-tested notes — check there first if a new interop crash is hit here).

## csproj interop references

`GamePlugin.csproj` only references `Assembly-CSharp`, `Unity.TextMeshPro`, and `UnityEngine.UI`
from `BepInEx\interop\` by default. If you need other UnityEngine/Il2Cpp types (e.g. `Resources`,
`TextAsset`, `Il2CppSystem.Type`), add explicit `<Reference>` + `<HintPath>` entries pointing at
the matching DLL under `BepInEx\interop\` — e.g. `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`, `Il2CppSystem.dll`,
`Il2Cppmscorlib.dll` (the latter two are both needed: `Il2CppSystem.Type` itself lives in
`Il2Cppmscorlib.dll`, not `Il2CppSystem.dll`). Also watch for `Object` ambiguity between
`UnityEngine.Object` and `System.Object`/`object` — fully qualify as `UnityEngine.Object` in method
signatures once both namespaces are in scope.

## Confirmed-unsafe patterns

- **Any generic Il2Cpp interop call** — `TryCast<T>()`, `Cast<T>()`, `AddComponent<T>()`, generic
  `FindObjectsOfType<T>()`, `ClassInjector.RegisterTypeInIl2Cpp<T>()` — anywhere in this plugin,
  not just inside `Load()`. Confirmed unsafe even during normal gameplay callbacks.
- Don't wrap interop-touching logic in a generic helper method — keep Harmony patch bodies and
  any IL2CPP-object-handling code as concrete, non-generic methods.
- `GetComponent(Type)`-style filtered lookups can return a wrong-typed result in this IL2CPP
  build family — guard with a manual type check rather than trusting the filter.

## Confirmed-safe patterns

- **Harmony patching** (prefix/postfix) is safe — ordinary `MethodInfo` resolution + IL detour,
  no generic-method reentrancy. Safe for per-frame hooks or API-intercept hooks (e.g. patching
  `Resources.Load`).
- **Non-generic `(IntPtr)` / `(string)` constructors** on IL2CPP wrapper types (e.g.
  `new TextAsset(ptr)`, `new TextAsset(text)`) are the safe way to convert/construct objects
  instead of generic `Cast<T>()`/`TryCast<T>()`.
  - **Caveat confirmed for this build (`be.785`):** `TextAsset` has **no public `(string)`
    constructor** — only a non-public `()` ctor and a public `(IntPtr)` pointer-wrap ctor. To
    build a new `TextAsset` from text, invoke the non-public empty ctor via a cached
    `ConstructorInfo` and then call the native `static void TextAsset.Internal_CreateInstance(TextAsset self, string text)`
    icall (mirrors Unity's own `TextAsset(string)` source). Still fully non-generic — safe. See
    `ResourceIoPatches.CreateTextAsset` for the reference implementation. Don't assume other
    IL2CPP wrapper types have a `(string)` ctor either — verify per-type via reflection first.
- Guard on plain property reads (e.g. `Il2CppSystem.Type.FullName`) before doing anything — these
  are safe, non-invoking reads.

## Debugging tips

Before writing any interop-touching code, verify real signatures against the actual
`BepInEx\interop\*.dll` rather than trusting stub/dummy assemblies:

```csharp
var asm = Assembly.LoadFile(@"G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\LongYinLiZhiZhuan\BepInEx\interop\UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll");
Type[] types;
try { types = asm.GetTypes(); }
catch (ReflectionTypeLoadException ex) { types = ex.Types.Where(t => t != null).ToArray(); }
// then GetMethods()/GetConstructors() on the type you care about
```

Wrap any interop-touching plugin code in try/catch regardless — treat the IL2CPP host as
potentially unstable and fail safe (log, leave original values untouched) rather than throwing.
